And then, unless it is something really, … that I cannot do, then they'll probably be happy and after that to do it for you anyway _____-",464,485],

    [162,"No.",499,501],
    [163,"Or?  Okay, I mean, I'll do my best to take care of you but again, I'm only so good and I am not going to pretend.",501,508],
    [164,"Let me think on that.",508,509],
    [165,"Okay.",509,510],
    [166,"I'll think on that now.",510,512],
    [167,"I think, I think it will be good at least to sit down and say, ""Do you have a better solution than what I'm proposing"" and if he does and it sounds good to you, then I will take it over from a prescribing point of view so you don't need _____.",512,523],
    [168,"They give shots, right?",523,524],

    [174,"Oh!  I don't agree.",543,545],
    [175,"Yeah.  No, no.  He is a local.  So, you could have at least sit down in a brain-to-brain.",545,550],
    [176,"Um-hum.",550,551],
    [177,"You could see options and if he says, ""Well, it would be better if you did this, and then this combination of other pill types"" -",551,558],
    [178,"Yeah.",558,560],
    [179,"And then, if you thought, ""Yeah, works good"", and then, I could take it over.",560,564],

    [181,"Ah, just an option, I mean -",565,566],
    [182,"Okay.",566,567],

    [185,"- if there's somebody who can help you and do that better than I can, then, I'd say, go for it.  So, think about it in the back of your mind because there's other pain clinic in Woodstock as well that we had talked about.  Um, so, let say Peterson??  At least for a consultation as we call it.",572,589],
