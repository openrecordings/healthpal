  Listening back to your recording is a key part of making the project a success.
%p
  Listening to the recording from your visit can:
  %br
  ● Remind you of changes to your treatment
  %br
  ● Hear advice from your doctor and things recommended for you to do
  %br
  ● Realize things you forgot to mention 
  %br
%p
  You may also want to share your recording with a family member or friend to keep them up to date with your care.
